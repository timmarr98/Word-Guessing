### How to play

The premise of the Word Guessing game is to progress through levels by entering words using the characters available. Each character is assigned a value (from the scrabble index) which is incremented every level, based on the value of the current mash of letters. The player has an accumulated score to the right of the entry box, to judge their progress.
